# DR. ME: Common Edition
______________________________________________________

In Dr. Me, you will have the virtual opportunity to save your health by 
correctly treating pathogen invasions into the body.

_______________________________________________________

You have the opportunity to take a journey through a highly-infected body
for fun! You will be guided by the smartest man in the universe...Dr. Rick 
Sanchez (and lots of advice from WebMD).  In each region you visit, you 
will be confronted by several common pathogens that wreak havoc on the 
body. A description of symptoms sets the stage for your evaluation of the 
infection, and your advice for this highly-infected body. Your expertise in 
taking care of the body will be rewarded by points and retaining your health.
Can you save this highly-infected body from the common pathogens of the world?
So much fun! Amirite?!?! We have music, we have windows, we have a User 
Interface that makes it simple to play. It is a fun game meant solely for entertainment. 

FULL DISCLOSURE: In no way is this game a substitute for true medical advice
from a healthcare professional. Do NOT take this game seriously. At all. 

You will be presented with a brief welcome to the game where we gather your name,
because we are friends now. Then you have a choice of body region to enter. You
will be presented with a question and several possible answers, all related to 
pathogen infection in that body region. Your wisdom and luck, along with your 
selection of answer A, B or C will determine whether this highly-infected body 
retains health points or succumbs to the pathogens.

* This is a simple RPG created mostly for the purpose of conducting training in AGILE.
* More features may or may not be forthcoming.
* This game was intended to also be the start of a training game, to educate the player along the way.
* However, we got a hold of it during a refactor sprint and completely derailed that option.
* It is just silliness that we invented while refining our AGILE techniques.
